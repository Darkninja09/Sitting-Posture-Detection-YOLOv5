Hi, This will only work in Python 3.9.X versions use pyenv or any other version control to do so
create a venv
run pip install requirements according to your system 
finally run application.py 

\data\inference model contains small640.pt and yolov5l.pt use them or any other better model by downloading the .pt file and copying it there, Change model name = "Your model name" in application.py and run it using pyenv exec python application.py if you are using pyenv for version control.

I am adding a link to the original repo I used, https://github.com/itakurah/Sitting-Posture-Detection-YOLOv5.git

Send me your github id's and I'll add you guys to the project

Thanks
best regards
Shivansh
